# Ember CSS Transitions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/peec/ember-css-transitions.svg) [![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-css-transitions.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-css-transitions)

This addon provides a nice way of defining CSS Transitions for Ember Components. Which means, only css based animations for performance - and no animation library needed.

Ember CSS Transitions is heavily inspired (and CSS compatible) with:

- [React's CSS Transitions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) (the implementation is mostly based on React)
- [Angular's CSS Transitions](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate)

Animations are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class attached to a HTML element, you can apply animations to it.


## Documentation

- [http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/](http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/)

## How it works

**Utimately you define your animations and transitions with ONLY CSS.**

```css
.example-enter {
  opacity: 0.01;
}

.example-enter.example-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}
.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

.example-leave.example-leave-active {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transition: opacity .5s ease-in;
}
```

There are two ways of defining transitions, 
And if you use the `{{transition-group}}` component you can then do something like this ( there is also a mixin you can use for custom components):

```handlebars
{{#if shouldShowThis}}
    {{#transition-group transition-class="example"}}
        This is animated in.
    {{/transition-group}}
{{/if}}
```

`ember-css-transitions` will automatically manage the lifecycle of the css classes applied so that it makes the animation on `didInsertElement` and `willDestroyElement`. It adds `enter` suffix and `enter-active` when `didInsertElement` is applied. The same for `willDestroyElement`, but then it adds `yourclass-leave` and `yourclass-leave-active`.


For example and docs, see: [http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/](http://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/)

## Install

Install it is simple:

```
ember install ember-css-transitions

```

**Note** Installing ember-cli-autoprefixer is suggested for CSS transitions:

```
ember install ember-cli-autoprefixer
```



## Tested in the following browsers / platforms:

- [x] IE 10
- [x] IE 11
- [x] Microsoft Edge
- [x] Chrome
- [x] Firefox
- [x] Safari
- [x] Android
- [x] iPhone

Note: **IE9** does not support CSS3 transitions / animations. They must live with no animations / transitions.
